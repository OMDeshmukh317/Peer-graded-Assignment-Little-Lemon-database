# THIS SUBMISSION BELONGS TO HANNA SYCHOVA
## Hi, it's a description to my lab

### ER-diagram
To review the ER-diagram you can check a screenshot (MODEL.jpg) or load .mwb in a folder [Diagram](Diagram)

### DB dump and queries
Dump including data, functions and procedures can be found in [Queries](Queries)
Queries as SQL source code and screenshots can be found in [Module2](Queries/Module2)
But please be careful - in module 2 "ManageBooking" was called "AddValidBooking", and screens preserve this name. But dump contains properly named procedure

### Data analytics (work with Tableau)
Data analythics, inc. workbook and screens, can be found in folder [Tableau](Tableau)

### Python client
Python client is stored in [PythonClient](PythonClient). It contains both screens and source code in .py file, not jupiter
